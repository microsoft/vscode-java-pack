## Telemetry

This extension collects telemetry data to help us build a better experience for building Java applications with VS Code. We only collect data on which commands are executed. We do not collect any information about names, addresses, paths, etc. The extension respects the `telemetry.enableTelemetry` setting which you can learn more about in our [FAQ](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting).
