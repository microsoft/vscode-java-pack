## Install JDK

If you don't have JDK installed on your machine, you can install it by clicking on __Install JDK__.

To verify it's installed, [create a new terminal](command:workbench.action.terminal.new) and try running the following command:

```
java -version
```

You should see something similar to the following:

```
openjdk version "11.0.11" 2021-04-20
```

The detailed output will be based on the JDK you install
